1. What does Compass do?
- Watches a specific folder based on config.rb
- Converts/interprets/writes the SASS it finds into csss



2. What does SASS do?
- Lazy.
- Compass does all the work. SASS is a syntax just like JSX. It's useful to devs to write CSS fast. 
- It MUST be turned into CSSS to be useful.



3. What does config.rb do?
- Ruby file
- Tells compass what to do!
- (Compass is looking for it)
	-tells Compas what to look for (scss)
	-tells Compass where to look(inside /sass/)
	-Tells Compass where to write (../public/stylesheets)
- Compass is a Ruby gem



4. Why is the file in public/stylesheets called styles.css?
- Because Compass is:
	1. Watching the /sass directiory
	2. There is a file called "styles" that is a .scss file there
